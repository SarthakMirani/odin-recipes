    <p>
        Carrot Halwa, or Gajar ka Halwa, is a traditional Indian dessert that dates back to the Mughal era. It is believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in North India, where carrots were widely grown in winter. The word halwa comes from the Arabic word ḥulw, meaning sweet, indicating Persian and Middle Eastern influences on Indian cuisine during Mughal rule. The dish was traditionally made with slow-cooked grated carrots, milk, ghee, and sugar, often enriched with cardamom, nuts, and khoya (reduced milk solids).

        Over time, Gajar ka Halwa became a staple dessert in Indian households, especially during winter and festivals like Diwali and Holi. Its popularity spread across the country, with variations emerging based on regional preferences. Some modern versions use condensed milk for convenience, while others add ingredients like mawa or saffron for a richer taste. Despite the innovations, the dish remains a symbol of warmth, celebration, and indulgence in Indian cuisine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups carrots, grated</li>
        <li>2 cups full-fat milk</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>½ tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup khoya (mawa) (optional, for a richer taste)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp raisin (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add grated carrots and sauté for 4–5 minutes until they soften slightly.</li>
        <li>Pour in milk and stir well.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the milk reduces and thickens (about 20-25 minutes).</li>
