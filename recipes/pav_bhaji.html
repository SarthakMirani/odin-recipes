    <p>
        Pav Bhaji originated in Mumbai, India, in the mid-19th century during the textile mill boom. It was created as a quick and filling meal for mill workers who had limited lunch breaks. Street vendors near the mills improvised by mashing a variety of leftover vegetables and mixing them with spices, serving the dish with buttered pav (bread rolls). This made for a nutritious and affordable meal that was easy to eat on the go.

        Over time, Pav Bhaji gained popularity beyond the mills and became a beloved street food across India. Vendors began experimenting with different variations, adding ingredients like cheese, paneer, and even fusion elements. Today, it is a staple in Indian cuisine, enjoyed in restaurants and homes alike, often served with a generous dollop of butter and chopped onions.
