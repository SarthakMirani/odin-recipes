        Shakshuka is a North African and Middle Eastern dish with roots tracing back centuries. Its exact origin is debated, but it is widely believed to have originated in the Maghreb region, which includes Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya. The name "shakshuka" comes from a Maghrebi Arabic word meaning "a mixture," reflecting its combination of poached eggs in a spiced tomato and pepper sauce. Some food historians suggest that it was influenced by Ottoman cuisine, which introduced tomato-based stews to the region.

        The dish gained widespread popularity when North African Jewish immigrants brought it to Israel, where it became a beloved staple. Over time, shakshuka evolved with regional variations, incorporating ingredients like feta cheese, spinach, or merguez sausage. Today, it is enjoyed worldwide as a hearty breakfast or brunch dish, known for its bold flavors and simple yet satisfying preparation.
